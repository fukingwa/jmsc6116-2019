<p>This short article aims to analyze and compare the English-version speeches made by Xi Jinping “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan” and Tsai Ing-wen’s response statement.</p>
<p>First at all, we install the required libraries and load them into the system.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(&quot;tm&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;tm&quot;, repos=&quot;https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/&quot;)
if (!require(&quot;wordcloud&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;wordcloud&quot;, repos=&quot;https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/&quot;)
if (!require(&quot;wordcloud2&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;wordcloud2&quot;, repos=&quot;https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/&quot;)
if (!require(&quot;plotly&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;, repos=&quot;https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, let’s obtain the copy of Xi Jinping’s speech.The file is already uploaded to my GitHub in plain text format. The first five lines of his speech are displayed for checking.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- url(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmsc-bc4j/JMSC6116_public/master/xi_taiwan.txt&quot;) # Establish a connection via url
xi &lt;- readLines(con)  # Read line by line from the connection to a string array xi
close(con) # Remember to close the connection after use
xi[1:5] # List the first five lines of Xi&#39;s speech</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Highlights of Xi&#39;s speech at Taiwan message anniversary event&quot;                                                                                                     
## [2] &quot;&quot;                                                                                                                                                                  
## [3] &quot;President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at a gathering held Wednesday in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of issuing Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. &quot;
## [4] &quot;&quot;                                                                                                                                                                  
## [5] &quot;Here are highlights of President Xi&#39;s speech:&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, we get the copy of Tsai’s speech.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- url(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmsc-bc4j/JMSC6116_public/master/tsai_taiwan.txt&quot;)
tsai &lt;- readLines(con)
close(con)</code></pre>
<p>Then, we define a R function, namely Preprocessing, to convert all characters into lower case (consistency for counting purpose), remove the punctuations and “stopwords”, and “clean” the text data into a format for next step. The first portion of the “cleaned” version of Xi’s speech are displayed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Preprocessing &lt;- function(doc){
  #create corpus
  doc.corpus &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(doc))
  #clean up
  doc.corpus &lt;- tm_map(doc.corpus, function(x)chartr(&quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;,&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;,x))### Convert to lower case
  doc.corpus &lt;- tm_map(doc.corpus, removePunctuation)   ### remove punctuation
  doc.corpus &lt;- tm_map(doc.corpus, function(x)removeWords(x,stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)))  #### remove stopwords
  return(doc.corpus)
}

xi &lt;- paste(xi,collapse=&quot; &quot;) # Collapse into one single line
tsai &lt;- paste(tsai,collapse=&quot; &quot;)
xi.p &lt;- Preprocessing(xi) # Send the array xi to the function for data cleaning
tsai.p &lt;- Preprocessing(tsai) # Output the results to xi.p and tsai.p (class &quot;Corpus&quot;)
substr(xi.p$content,1,200) # Inspect the first 200 words of Xi&#39;s &quot;cleaned&quot; speech</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;highlights  xis speech  taiwan message anniversary event  president xi jinping delivered  speech   gathering held wednesday  beijing  commemorate  40th anniversary  issuing message  compatriots  taiwa&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Ok. So far so good. We now compare the highest frequency terms used in Xi and Tsai’s speeches . To do this, a term document matrix, which stores terms used (by rows) and the two leaders (by columns), is created.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(Corpus(VectorSource(c(xi.p$content,tsai.p$content)))) # Create a term document matrix
tdm &lt;- as.matrix(tdm) # convert it into a standard matrix
colnames(tdm) &lt;- c(&quot;Xi&#39;s speech&quot;,&quot;Tsai&#39;s speech&quot;) # Assign the names to the columns</code></pre>
<p>Here you go. The top-5 high frequency term plot is presented. The variable “Num_of_term_shown” is defined to control the number of displayed terms. You modify the number, i.e. first line “Num_of_terms_shown &lt;- 5” which means 5 is asigned to the variable “Num_of_terms_shown”, and rerun the program to see the changes.</p>

<p>Question: is term frequency a good way for comparison? If not, what is a better option? How can we make a better plot? Hints:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste0(&quot;Total number of terms of Xi&#39;s speech (cleaned version):&quot;,sum(tdm[,&quot;Xi&#39;s speech&quot;])))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Total number of terms of Xi&#39;s speech (cleaned version):678&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste0(&quot;Total number of terms of Hu&#39;s speech (cleaned version):&quot;,sum(tdm[,&quot;Tsai&#39;s speech&quot;])))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Total number of terms of Hu&#39;s speech (cleaned version):470&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, we visualize the text frequency by using wordcloud function and put them side-by-side.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>min.freq &lt;- 2 # Minimium number of word frequency
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # 1x2 panel plot
par(mar=c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) # Set the plot margin
par(bg=&quot;black&quot;) # background color is black
par(col.main=&quot;white&quot;) # Title color is white
wordcloud(xi.p, scale=c(5,.5),min.freq=min.freq, max.words=Inf, random.order=F, colors=brewer.pal(8, &quot;Accent&quot;),family=&quot;serif&quot;)   
title(&quot;Xi Jinping&#39;s Speech&quot;)
wordcloud(tsai.p, scale=c(5,.5),min.freq=min.freq, max.words=Inf, random.order=F, colors=brewer.pal(8, &quot;Accent&quot;),family=&quot;mono&quot;)   
title(&quot;Tsai Ing-wen&#39;s Speech&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="lecture1_2019_files/figure-html/wc-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, we generate a comparison wordcloud, which compares the relative frequency with which a term was used in the two speeches. For example, Xi used the word “reunification” and “said” more frequenctly than did Tsai and the word cloud thus prints the term “reunification”, “comnpatriots” and “said” in the side of Xi. By the same token, you find “taiwaness”, “crossstrait”, “democracy”, and “consultation” are closer to Tsai’s side. The plot shows the difference between the language usage of the leaders and sheds light on the discourse of their speeches.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison.cloud(tdm,max.words=100,random.order=FALSE, colors=c(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;),family=&quot;serif&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="lecture1_2019_files/figure-html/cw-1.png" width="672" /></p>
